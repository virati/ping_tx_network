## Contrasting network traces from low- and high-frequency DBS

## Overview
Efforts to identify electrophysiologic correlates of structural engagement in DBS are growing \cite{}.
However, it remains unclear how congruent networks traced out during 2Hz stimulation are to 100+Hz stimulation.
Since most therapeutic DBS is done at 100+Hz, clarifying any discrepancies will be critical for both clinical practice and scientific inquiry.
In this repository we take a computational approach to
